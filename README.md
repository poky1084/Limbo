# Limbo
Limbo bot with Lua for Stake.com
Latest release: https://github.com/WinMachine777/Limbo/releases/tag/1.0.4.0

Discord: 0000000#7073 <br />

If you want to compile yourself, then download the sourcecode and put `cf.exe` and `node_modules` folder from the release zip into the same directory as the Limbo.exe

I signed both exe cf.exe and Limbo.exe with a local certificate.

About cf.exe is a NodejS javascript file bundled with nodejs into executable, which runs a cloudflare proxy on localhost on port 3000 to bypasss checks. I gonna upload the javascript file.
